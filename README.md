# Wordl Bot

Play wordle on your discord server! Inspired by the ever amazing Josh Wardle's puzzle game and other variations of it.

## How to use
Invite this bot to your server. Link will go here.

Use ```!``` as prefix with these commands:
- ```start``` to start a session
- ```guess``` to make a guess

The game will start as ```normal``` mode by default, the good old-fashioned, one five-lettered word. However in the future we will have ```manic``` and ```legend``` mode options to spice up the race.
